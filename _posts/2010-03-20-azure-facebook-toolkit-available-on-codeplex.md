Before I came back to Microsoft I was working at [Thuzi](http://www.thuzi.com/), a social media company. One of the things [Thuzi](http://www.thuzi.com/) does is create facebook applications for businesses. Durning this time, a framework fell out of our applications that is now published on [Codeplex](http://facebookazuretoolkit.codeplex.com/). It is not going to be a perfect fit for every facebook application, yet it does include enough samples to get you going and some helpful classes to make using Azure and Facebook easier. If you want to know more about the applications and the toolkit, you can watch [Jim Zimmerman](http://www.jimzimmerman.com/blog/) give a talk on it at MIX10 [here](http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/EX23). Thanks to Jim for getting it out there. Go get it [here](http://facebookazuretoolkit.codeplex.com/).
