We just released our Release Candidate for the book that should be out in the next month. This is the second version of the original that includes new content on Single Sign Out, Windows Azure Access Control Service and SharePoint. If you are interested in Identity (and you should be), you need to get this [guide](http://claimsid.codeplex.com/). We would love any feedback before this is out. [Download](http://claimsid.codeplex.com/) and become a claims / identity expert.

Enjoy!
