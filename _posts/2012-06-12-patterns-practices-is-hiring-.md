I guess the cat is out of the bag or at least it is going to be so here is the post from Bob:

[patterns & practices is hiring!](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bobbrum/archive/2012/06/11/patterns-amp-practices-is-hiring.aspx)  (Via [Notes From the Team Room](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bobbrum/).)

I can't say enough about the p&p team and you should come work in the group. I am a long time member of this group and the reason I keep coming back (they call me the boomerang) is because they do awesome work.

If you want to be part of an incredible group of people working on cool tech, apply now!

Enjoy!
