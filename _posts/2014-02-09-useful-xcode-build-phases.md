[Useful Xcode Build Phases - Matthew Morey](http://matthewmorey.com/xcode-build-phases/?utm_campaign=iOS_Dev_Weekly_Issue_131&utm_medium=email&utm_source=iOS%2BDev%2BWeekly):

> In an effort to improve my code quality I have started using some helpful Xcode Build Phases.
> Build phases are descriptions of tasks that need to be performed by Xcode during a build. Build Phases can be added from the Editor menu (Editor -> Add Build Phase).
