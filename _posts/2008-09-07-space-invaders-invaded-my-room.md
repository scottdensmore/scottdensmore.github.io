The wife knows how much I love my video games so she sent me some [wall paper](http://www.whatisblik.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=B&amp;Product_Code=BL-106A&amp;utm_source=tellafriend&amp;utm_medium=taf-email) based on [Space Invaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). When we finally get our new house, this is definitely going up in my room.
