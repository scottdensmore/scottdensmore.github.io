[Simply Writing Tests Is Not Test Driven Development](https://spin.atomicobject.com/writing-tests-is-not-tdd/):

> "![Article](https://spin.atomicobject.com/writing-tests-is-not-tdd/)There is a common misunderstanding in the software world â€” simply writing tests isn't test driven development. [Test driven development](http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) (TDD) is about ensuring that your software is functioning, as well as ensuring that the software's internals are well designed, reusable, and decoupled."
