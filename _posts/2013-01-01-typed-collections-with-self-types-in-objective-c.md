[Jonathan Sterling – Typed Collections with Self Types in Objective-C](http://www.jonmsterling.com/posts/2012-02-05-typed-collections-with-self-types-in-objective-c.html):

> The latest versions of the Clang compiler extend the Objective-C language with related return types, which allow a limited form of covariance to be expressed. Methods with certain names (`alloc`, `init`, etc.) are inferred to return an object of the instance type for the receiver; other methods can participate in this covariance by using the `instancetype` keyword for the return type annotation.

This is what I really want in the next version of Objective C.

Enjoy!
