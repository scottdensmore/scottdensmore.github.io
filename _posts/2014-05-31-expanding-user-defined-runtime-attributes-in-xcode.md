[Expanding User-Defined Runtime Attributes in Xcode](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/05/30/xcode-runtime-attributes/):

> When building a user interface, I appreciate an IDE that allows me to easily change visual elements without having to write code. Writing code for simple things like colors, borders, fonts, or shadows clutters my project. Fortunately, I work with talented designers at Atomic Object who can already use Xcode to make some of these aesthetic changes in the UI without needing to write extra code.

Pretty cool trick I am going to have to try.
