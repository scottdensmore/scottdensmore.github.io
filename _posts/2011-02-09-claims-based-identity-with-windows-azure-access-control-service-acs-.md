We are making good headway on our new project.  We have started converting our current scenarios over to ACS.  [Eugenio](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eugeniop/) has a couple of great posts on our first scenario using ACS as a Federation Provider.

* [Access Control Service as a Federation Provider](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eugeniop/archive/2011/02/08/access-control-service-as-a-federation-provider.aspx)
* [ACS as a Federation Provider - A little bit deeper into the sample (Home Realm Discovery)](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eugeniop/archive/2011/02/09/acs-as-a-federation-provider-a-little-bit-deeper-into-the-sample-home-realm-discovery.aspx)

As always go over to the [Claims Identity codeplex site](http://claimsid.codeplex.com/) and provide feedback.  We are hoping to have our first drop the first of next week.
