Wanted to give a big shout out to the guys putting on this event. [Scott](http://www.scottcreynolds.com/), [Sean](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/sean_chambers/), the guys from [Blue Spire](http://www.bluespire.com/) (along with others) did a great job presenting this information. And [Joe (aka Devfish)](http://www.devfish.net/default.aspx) \[Microsoft\] for sponsoring the space. I hope to be able to attend and speak at more of these events in the future .
