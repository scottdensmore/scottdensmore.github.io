With my new fascination with the [Mac platform](http://developer.apple.com/), I have been playing with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) and [Cocoa](http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/). I just read this morning that Miguel de Icaza just noticed that Enterprise Library is MS-PL and they can put it on the Mono platform. Might be time for me to because a contributor to port [Unity](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc468366.aspx) to the Mono platform. I am glad to see something I spent a large chunk of my life working on getting further out in the world.

Also a quick shout out to [Chris T.](http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/) for continuing the success of the Enterprise Library project.
