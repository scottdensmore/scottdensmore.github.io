Sitting here watching the College Football Playoffs, I hear [21rst Century Schizoid Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Schizoid_Man) being played by one of the bands. I said "Wow! I am surprised to here that song, it is 48 years old.". My oldest daughter said "What? That song is only a few years old.". After a little more schooling on both sides, I realized it is a song by Kayne West called [Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_%28Kanye_West_song%29). I played the original for the kids: there was much eye rolling.
