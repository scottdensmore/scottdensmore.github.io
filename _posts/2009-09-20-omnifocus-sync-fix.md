I use [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/) on my phone and laptop to keep myself organized. I have had to look this up a couple of times so I thought I would put it up here. If you get sync issues while using MobileMe as your sync location, there is a problem where [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/) will get stuck trying to login using your information in the keychain. If you delete the idisk.me.com login from you keychain, things get back to normal. Hope this helps me remember next time.
