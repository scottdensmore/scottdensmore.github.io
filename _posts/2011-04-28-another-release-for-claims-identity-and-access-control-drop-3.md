We just posted another drop for the [Claims Based Identity Guidance](http://claimsid.codeplex.com/). Â This will be our last drop before we release. We would love any feedback. This new drop includes:

* All samples for ACS (updated to ACS production version).
* A sample for using WP7 as a client for REST services
* All previous samples refactored and cleaned-up
* A new Dependency Checker (much simplified).
* A new sample with ACS as a Federation Provider
* All ACS chapters
* Two appendices on protocols and authorization strategies

What are you waiting for? Go [download](http://claimsid.codeplex.com/releases/view/65176) the new drop and give your feedback!
