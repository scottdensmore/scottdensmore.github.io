Every year I say I am going to WWDC and every year it passes and I say "Next year for sure.".  This year I decided it was time to put up or shut up. I did my best: I was ready at 10, logged in and started the process. I got to the checkout process after a few restarts and a couple of browsers and after I entered all my info and clicked place order, server error. 

As many have reported, I got my call from Apple (although I thought it was a joke from my friends since they were sitting there when I got denied). I booked my hotel and flight and ready to go. 

I am using [Jeff Lamarche's First Time Guide](http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2013/04/wwdc-first-timers-guide-2013-edition.html).  

* Arriving Early Sunday - check
* Staying within Walking Distance - check
* For the few people I know, planned meetings - check
* Geek gear bought - check
* Excited  - check

I do feel bad for all the people who will not get to go. I was hoping to meet some of the cool kids while I was there yet some of them that will not be there. I plan on saying hi to as many as a can without "Being Creepy".
