It always takes a while for your project to go live on MSDN but it is alive… ALIVE!  We really put a lot of effort into this one and is the last in the series. You should go [check it out](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh871440.aspx).

I have spent the past couple of years knee deep with Windows Azure and it has been awesome.  I can't believe what we were able to accomplish:

* [Moving Applications to the Cloud, 2nd Edition](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff728592.aspx)
* [Developing Applications for the Cloud, 2nd Edition](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff966499.aspx)
* [Building Hybrid Applications in the Cloud on Windows Azure](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh871440.aspx)
* [A Guide to Claims-Based Identity and Access Control (2nd Edition)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff423674.aspx)

Working on our new project is completely new! Will let you know more later!
