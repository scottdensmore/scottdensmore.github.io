The guys at SouthWorks have been hard at work again.  We have been using the same setup program for our Windows Azure Projects to configure ACS for a while now.  It is a bit rough around the edges but we have not had time to invest a little upgrade. Well, leave it to these guys to go above and beyond: Jorge Rowies has create a fluent API for setting things up. Looks great.
