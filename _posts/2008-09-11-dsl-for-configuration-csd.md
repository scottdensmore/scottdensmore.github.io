When we first built the configuration editor for Enterprise Library, we always wanted the ability to have people build their own configuration elements that could be edited inside the tool. This was limited to only new application blocks and we did ship a Guidance Package that "helped" in Enterprise Library 3.x. When we shipped Enterprise Library 4 and Unity, we did not have a configuration editor for Unity. I have found a new tool that helps me build my Unity Configuration sections that I need for my extensions. [CSD](http://www.codeplex.com/csd) is pretty cool and has a lot of promise. I am using it for all my new configuration needs.
