[Overcoming Customer Inertia](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/contrast/blog/~3/EQUqJtFyQ9Q/):

> To create an anxiety relievable only by a purchase… that is the job of advertising.
> Advertising increases familiarity, reminds consumers about your product, and spreads product news. [We covered all that before.](http://blog.intercom.io/blog.intercom.io/what-jobs-does-advertising-do/) Today we’re looking at a fourth job advertising does: it defeats inertia.
> Getting Customers to Switch
> People don’t hate progress, they just prefer inertia. This stops them from buying your product even when it’s the logical choice."
