[ParisLemon — What A Difference Six Years Makes...](http://parislemon.com/post/61777379694/what-a-difference-six-years-makes):

> Steve Ballmer, 2007:
> Right now we’re selling millions and millions and millions of phones a year. Apple is selling zero phones a year.
> Steve Ballmer, a few months later:
> It’s sort of a funny question. Would I trade 96% of the market for 4% of the market? (Laughter.) I want to have products that appeal to everybody. Now we’ll get a chance to go through this again in phones and music players. There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.
> Steve Ballmer, yesterday:
> Mobile devices. We have almost no share.

6 years to late for Ballmer to go. I hope they find someone who can lead Microsoft to a new glory.
