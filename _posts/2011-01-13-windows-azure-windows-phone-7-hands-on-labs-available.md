After all the work we have done to ship the last 3 guides, we decided to go the extra mile and create some Hands On Labs (HOL) for each of the guides. These HOLs will guide you through development of the key features of the apps distributed with the books. Go get them today and learn even more about building Windows Azure and Windows Phone 7 applications.

* [Moving Applications to the Cloud](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff728592.aspx)
* [Developing Applications for the Cloud](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff966499.aspx)
* [Windows Phone 7 Developer Guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg490765.aspx)

Feed back always welcome.

**Note:**

These HOLs are using the Windows Azure 1.2 SDK.  We are working on updating the content and HOLs to the Windows Azure 1.3 SDK.  These will be available on CodePlex as soon as we get them done.
