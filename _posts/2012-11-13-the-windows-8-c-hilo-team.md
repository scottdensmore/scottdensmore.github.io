My last hurrah at patterns & practices was the C++ Windows 8 app Hilo. It made it into the Windows SDK. It is amazing how much we got done and how much I learned over the time. i must really say that I love working with the new C++. You should go check out the docs and here is the team:

Really miss these guys!

Go check out the [docs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj160316.aspx), [download the sample](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Hilo-C-sample-b53fd433) and [build great apps](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/team-foundation-service)!

Enjoy!
