In May of last year I moved from Seattle to Florida. For about the first 2 months I lived in temporary housing in a condo in a little town called [Celebration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebration,_Florida). Since then we have rented a home here. We really love it here and hopefully after this year we will buy something. Yesterday my youngest daughter and I spent some time running around town.

![Fireworks](/assets/img/fireworks.jpg)The fireworks over the lake (which is to my right) were absolutely beautiful. This is also the home of Fred the Alligator. They decorate the whole town for Christmas. They also have "snope" shows every night until New Year's Eve. I say "snope" because it is fake snow that is some kind of soap.

![Attention to detail](/assets/img/attention-to-detail.jpg)The thing that amazes me is the attention to detail. Even the street signs are done.  

I miss my peeps in Seattle, although I sure don't miss the snow that got dumped on them. Hopefully everyone is enjoying their town.
