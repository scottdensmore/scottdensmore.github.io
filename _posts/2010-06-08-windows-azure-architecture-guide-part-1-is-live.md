It took a lot longer to get out than we hoped, but it is finally here. [Part 1 is live](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff728592.aspx) (at least the landing page). If you have feedback, we would love to here it. You can post at our [codeplex site](http://wag.codeplex.com/). Download and enjoy.
