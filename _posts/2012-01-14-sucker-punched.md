My daughter was sucker punched on the bus after school.

This is an unofficial account of the event as told to me by my daughter.  I am pretty sure it is correct after the call from the principle.

Anna got on the bus. She was walking back to take a seat when a kindergarden student started to sit next to a 3rd grade boy. The boy told the kindergarden girl not to sit down, went to punch her before Anna grabbed his hand and said "Don't you dare!". The little girl went towards the back of the bus and sat down. Anna sat down next to her friend and started to chat for the way home. She turned around to check on the little girl and "BAM", the 3rd grader [sucker punched](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucker_punch) her.

She stood up as the boy threatened to hit her again, yet she stood strong and said if he hit her, she would hit him back. Every kid scattered and the bus driver came back and broke things up and took both kids off the bus. The principle took the 3rd grader, called his parents and let Anna come home on the bus.

Needless to say, I was livid. I couldn't believe someone hit my baby. I was not allowed to get in the car to drive down to the school or call a lawyer. (I know Anna did not get her patience from me.)

After I calmed, I was proud papa. Two things happened all at once: she stood up for someone who needed it; she took a punch and didn't fight back. I talked to her and told her how proud I was that she could control her emotions. I could not believe it.

I am still amazed about this. I guess the wife and I have not done to bad so far (although I give her all the credit).
