After our first week, we have the baseline application that we will be converting to Azure in our first scenario. The site is live and we are ready to start taking feedback. This next week will focus on making the application work in Azure. We will be moving the database to Azure and the profile store to Table Storage. We will also be moving the AD provider to claims from the STS via tokens. We are making great progress and would love any feedback.

Go check it out at our [CodePlex site](http://wag.codeplex.com).
