I was reading [Alex Homer's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alexhomer) this morning (shame on you if you are not reading it), and it got me thinking: Do I still like to experiment?

In his [latest post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alexhomer/archive/2012/04/08/who-ate-all-the-pi.aspx), he talks about the need to experiment and what people are doing today. I agree with him and it got me thinking of what I do these days to experiment. Mostly it comes down to languages and devices which I have been doing this most of my life. Lately it has been Windows 8 using C++ and XAML.

I know many people have nightmares about C++, but with C++'11 and the new modern COM (WinRT), things are much better (and fun). We are working on a new project (Hilo) that is all about building a Metro app with C++. This is another chapter in the original [Hilo project that was built for Windows 7](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff708696.aspx).

I will be talking more about it as we get closer. We are getting ready to have a release on CodePlex.

Enjoy!
