So I am back on the kick to get rid of cable.  I don't really watch anything except the cooking channel and the occasional football game. I decided to sign up for Netflix since I can put this on all my devices that I have (XBox 360, PS3, iPad, iPhone) and I can catch up on a lot of shows.

I re-activated my NetFlix account and changed my password. This is were all the trouble started. I setup my password (passphrase) that was more than the allowed 10 characters long (I missed this text that stated my password could only be 10 characters). Before I realized this, I started setting up my other devices. Funny thing about the setup, it is all different. Some devices require a code to activate them, some use the user name and password. Here is how I figured out something was wrong.

I set up the devices that require a code just fine.  Then I started to setup the PS3.  It required a user name and password.  I typed in them in and kept getting a log-in failure.  I logged back into the website with the same info just fine. Ok, let me try another device.  I logged into the iPhone and that worked. So next, I try the iPad and again I get the login failed message. Needless to say, I started to get a little frustrated.

After going through this for about an hour, I decided I would change my password. That is when I finally went back to change my password and notice the 10 character limit.  Once I changed my password, I got everything setup and running flawlessly.

NetFlix streaming is amazing and I love how it works. I am amazed that the authentication portion of the app didn't get the same attention.
