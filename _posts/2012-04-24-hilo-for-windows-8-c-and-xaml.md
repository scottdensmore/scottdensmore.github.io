The original [Hilo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff708696.aspx) is a C++ application for Windows 7 using Win 32 and Direct X. Now with the introduction of Windows 8, C++ is making a comeback. It helps that C++ '11 makes using C++ much easier. Xaml also adds the ability to build UIs using C++.Â 

We have been working on a new version of [Hilo for Windows 8](http://hilo.codeplex.com/) using C++ and Xaml. We just opened up the [CodePlex](http://hilo.codeplex.com/) site and the source is checked into a git repository. If you are interested in this scenario, go check it out. This will work with Windows 8 Consumer Preview and Visual Studio Express 11 Beta. Here are some things we cover:

* Unit Testing with C++
* Parallel Task Library for C++
* XAML with C++
* MVVM with C++

Enjoy and please provide feedback on the forums!
