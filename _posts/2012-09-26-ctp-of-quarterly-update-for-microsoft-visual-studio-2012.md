One of the things I love about working in Visual Studio is the now we are shipping on a much more timely cadence. We are going to start sending out quarterly updates to Visual Studio.  Another great thing we are doing is shipping CTPs (every 3 weeks)  of the updates.  So you can get access to the new features soon. Shipping more often is always a good thing. [Go get your new bits!](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34708)

And if you find bugs / problems please file a report at [Microsoft Connect](http://connect.microsoft.com).

Enjoy!
