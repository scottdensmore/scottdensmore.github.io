We just finished our last bit of testing on these hands on labs. They are a great companion to the guide that we released last year as an RC. One of the things I am really excited about in these hands on labs is our labs on AD FS V2. In our guide we talk about using AD FS V2 as an Identity Provider / STS and now we show you how to do it. Download both the guide and the hands on labs from [CodePlex](http://claimsid.codeplex.com/) and provide us feedback.

The AD FS V2 content map can be found [here](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2735.aspx). It has a lot of great content about AD FS V2 that can keep you on the path.

Enjoy!
