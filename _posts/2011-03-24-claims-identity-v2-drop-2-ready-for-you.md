As normal I am late to the party. We have been working hard on getting the [Claims Identity Guide](http://claimsid.codeplex.com/) updated for a V2. Our big focus for this drop is Windows Azure Access Control Service ([ACS](http://acs.codeplex.com/)). We have Federation, SOAP, and Rest services. We have passive clients (browser) and Active clients (WPF & Windows Phone 7).

[Eugenio](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eugeniop/) has a couple of great write ups for this release you should check out:

* [Drop #2 of Claims Identity Guide on CodePlex](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eugeniop/archive/2011/03/22/drop-2-of-claims-identity-guide-on-codeplex.aspx)
* [Authentication in WP7 client with REST Services–Part I](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eugeniop/archive/2011/03/24/authentication-in-wp7-client-with-rest-services-part-i.aspx)

Another cool project to check out is the [Windows Azure tools for Windows Phone 7](http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com/).  Right now I am working on two things that  I should have out soon:

* Multi Entity Schema storage
* ACS and iPhone

Happy coding!
