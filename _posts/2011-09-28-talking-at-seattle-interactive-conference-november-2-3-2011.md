I have been working on the iOS toolkit for Windows Azure lately. We are really close to another release (check out the develop branch if you are interested in the changes). Nov 2-3 I will be speaking at the [Seattle Interactive Conference](http://www.seattleinteractive.com/) (SIC) on iOS and Windows Azure. Most of the apps on your iOS device don't live on the device alone and uses services hosted somewhere in the "cloud". Windows Azure is a great platform for hosting the services. The toolkit for iOS makes accessing the services easy and intuitive. The talk will talk through how to do this. Bonus: if you come you can see the rest of this handsome [cast](http://www.seattleinteractive.com/conference/speakers/cld).
