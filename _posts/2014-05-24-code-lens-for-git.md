[Code Lens for Git in Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate Update 3](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/05/23/code-lens-for-git-in-visual-studio-2013-ultimate-update-3.aspx)

> Yesterday we released Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 CTP1. This CTP brings new features in the area of CodeLens Team indicators. In this Blog post I'll present the CodeLens Team indicators for Git.

I spent a year working on Code Lens. Our first implementation used TFS. We really wanted to add GIT support but just ran out of time. Now that time has come. If you have made the “right” decision and moved to GIT in TFS then Code Lens is available for you now.
