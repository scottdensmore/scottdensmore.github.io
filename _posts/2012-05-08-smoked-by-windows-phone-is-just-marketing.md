I am not a huge fan of the Windows Phone. It is a personal taste. I am not that into Metro. I keep seeing these things about being smoked by Windows Phone and it makes me sad. Are people really that gullible? Don't they realize that the person using the phone is an expert with the phone.  This is all they do. Do you really think the test is not rigged in every way to give the advantage to the Windows Phone? This reminds me of the quote from Princess Bride when Vizzini and the Man in Black go against each other:

> **Vizzini**: You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is "never get involved in a land war in Asia" - but only slightly less well-known is this: "Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line"! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha...  
> **Vizzini**: \[Vizzini stops suddenly, his smile frozen on his face and falls to the ground dead\]  
> **Buttercup**: And to think, all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.  
> **Man in Black**: They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.

I am pretty sure death is not on the line… just make sure you don't get fooled into not thinking for yourself.
