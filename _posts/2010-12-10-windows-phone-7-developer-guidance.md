Yesterday we released our [guidance on Windows Phone 7](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg490765.aspx).  This is a continuation of our Windows Azure Guidance that we did previously.  We took the survey application and  made a version for Windows Phone 7.  This guidance is a little more advance, yet we tried to make it very approachable.  Here are a few topics you will find in the guide:

* Prism for Windows Phone 7
* Reactive Extensions
* WCF Services on top of Windows Azure
* Push Notifications
* Camera & Voice
* Panorama
* Much more...

I am proud of the work we have done and we had an amazing team once again.  Hope you guys enjoy it as much as we enjoyed building it.
