I am getting old. Â I really like Visual Studio, but I am not a fan of the new all caps mode in the menu bar. If you want to stop yelling at you:

Open your registry editor and create the following registry key and value

`HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\11.0\\General\\SuppressUppercaseConversion  
REG\_DWORD value: 1`

Use at your own risk :).

Enjoy!
