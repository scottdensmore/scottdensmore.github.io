I don't like to talk much about politics (although this shouldn't be political): I just don't understand how so many people can be pro-life then once that person is born, they are on their own. In many states, abortions have a 3 day waiting period (WTF?) where you can get a gun and kill 17 kids whenever you want. Where is the protection for them? Most laws for waiting periods on guns are applied to handguns, not shotguns or rifles. Where are the TRAP laws for all guns?
