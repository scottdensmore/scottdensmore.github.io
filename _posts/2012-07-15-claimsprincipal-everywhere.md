Oh happy days! Every principal is derived from _ClaimsPrincipal_ in .NET 4.5. This makes all the work on the [book](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff423674.aspx#2ndEdition) we did that much more relevant now.  So if you want to know more about claims, [read the book](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff423674.aspx#2ndEdition) and follow this blog:

[WCF and Identity in .NET 4.5: Overview](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/leastprivilege/~3/miZM9LHLI-U/)

Enjoy!
