It is time for [Seattle Code Camp](https://seattle.codecamp.us/registered/default.aspx) again. There are plenty of great talks and if you are in the area you should go vote for the ones you will want to see. This year the talks are being held at building 92 ("The Commons") at Microsoft. I will be doing two talks:

> [Get You Head in the Cloud: Building and Migrating Apps for Azure](https://seattle.codecamp.us/sessions.aspx)
> Azure is Microsoft's platform for building your application in the cloud. Before coming back to Microsoft, I spent time building Facebook applications on top of the Azure platform. This talk will give a brief overview of Azure and then taking an existing application and moving it to Azure. Then we will discuss some of the changes to the app to take advantage of the Azure platform.
> [Agile Development for the iPhone: Tests, Mocks, and CI Oh My!](https://seattle.codecamp.us/sessions.aspx)
> For many the iPhone is a new and exciting platform for development. The new platform still brings the same questions "How do I test this?" and "How do I build this on my build server?". We will talk about unit testing tools, mocking tools, and how to setup your project to build on a Continuous Integration Server. The talk will focus on a small RSS reader application using OCUnit, Google Toolbox for Mac, GHUnit, and OCMock for unit testing. Then we will setup the project to run on a CI server (Hudson / Team City). The goal is to learn to setup up and run your environment for your iPhone project.

Hope to see you there.
