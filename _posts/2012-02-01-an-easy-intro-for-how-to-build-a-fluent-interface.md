[Jorge Rowies](http://blogs.southworks.net/jrowies/) does it again. If you saw / liked the [ACS Fluent Interface post](http://blogs.southworks.net/jrowies/2012/01/28/fluent-api-for-setting-up-windows-azure-acs/), you will love to read how you can do the same thing for your API. Go read his [new post](http://blogs.southworks.net/jrowies/2012/02/01/how-to-build-a-basic-fluent-interface-in-8-steps/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+master-feed+%28Southworks+Master+Feed%29) and enjoy!
