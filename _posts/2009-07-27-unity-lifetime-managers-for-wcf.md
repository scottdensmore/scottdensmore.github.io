Drew and I were having fun getting NHibernate working with WCF and Unity. I had built upon my brethren [Jimmy's code from this article](/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2008/09/16/integrating-structuremap-and-nhibernate-with-wcf.aspx) to making a session per request. I had let [Drew](http://drewdotnet.blogspot.com/) borrow the code, but forgot to mention that he would need to make his services per request. So, Drew and I talked and we upped the ante and created [LifetimeManager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc440953.aspx) objects for the contexts in WCF. He has a good description of it so I want hold you here any longer. Fun stuff and comes with a test client for playing with the different contexts.
