After many long nights and to much Starbuck's coffee, [Kevin](http://geekswithblogs.net/SunnyCoder/Default.aspx) and I have finally done it. The waiting game is over and they announced today that we won! Go check out [Impulse](http://www.myimpulselive.com/). I am still feverishly finishing up the iPhone app now that the OS 3.0 SDK has hit. You can still vote for us at [new CloudApp()](http://www.newcloudapp.com/) if you think our app is cool. Not sure when our app is going to be listed on Azure's page or the [new CloudApp()](http://www.newcloudapp.com/) page.. I hope soon.

We are still working on the iPhone app, getting a community portal built, and more. I should be blogging more about building on top of BizSpark, Azure, WCF, Silverlight, iPhone, Social media integration and building mobile apps for the cloud (not necessarily in that order).

Thanks to everyone out there that has voted for us!
