[Brad Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com) decided to [tag me geek](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/meme-time-growi.html).

Growing up geek was almost a given at my house even though I didn't know it. My Dad is an electrician and my Mom an accountant. I have terrible allergies and I were glasses. It all started when my Dad brought home the TI 99 where I learned to program, type and have fun. It sat right next to my Atari 2600 and consumed my time between Pitfall and Chopper Command. This snowballed into my Dad getting computers and fixing them. We had all the Commodores (Vic-20, 64, 128, Amega), Apple IIe, TRS 80, x86 etc. I even spent most of my time in the band playing the Double B-Flat upright concert bass (Tuba) and bass in the Jazz band.

These days not much have changed. Most people who meet me don't believe I am a big "geek". After I open my mouth, no one seems to doubt it. Also, I have been banned from bringing my laptop to the dinner table these days.

I tag [Jeidja](http://blogs.msdn.com/agilemonkey/) and [Jim Newkirk](http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com).
