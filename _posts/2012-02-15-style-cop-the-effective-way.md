We use Style Cop to keep everyone honost  on our projects. It make it easy and integrates pretty well with ReSharper. I have never stopped to write up how we do this, but [Geoff Cox](http://blogs.southworks.net/geoff) from SouthWorks does a pretty good job [here](http://blogs.southworks.net/geoff/2012/02/13/effective-stylecop/). Treat it like a new project… start from a blank slate.
