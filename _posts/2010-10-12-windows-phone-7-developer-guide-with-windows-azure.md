3 screens and a cloud is alive.  We have been working the past couple of months on a project that takes our Second Guide of Azure and adding a Windows Phone 7 client.  We have done a lot of work on this and happy with this release.  Any feedback welcome. Go get the RC release [here](http://wp7guide.codeplex.com/).
