Jason Zander's blog post on Unit Testing mentioned our Hilo project doing unit testing for Metro Applications in C++.

[My Favorite Features: Unit Testing Enhancements in Visual Studio 11](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jasonz/archive/2012/05/22/my-favorite-features-unit-testing-enhancements-in-visual-studio-11.aspx)Â 

If you are really interested in this, [download the code and check it out](http://hilo.codeplex.com/). We have to do some tricks to test asyc methods, but since everything is async these days, you will probably find it useful.

If you have any feedback, leave it on the site so we can put this into future releases.

Enjoy!
