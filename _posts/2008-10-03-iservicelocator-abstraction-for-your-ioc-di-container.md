[Chris Tavares](http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/) and others have developed an abstraction layer for your IoC / Dependency Container. This will help building your applications easier and changing out your IoC container. This is really not the amazing part. This is really a community effort that has adaptors for Castle Windsor, Spring.NET and Unity.

I am hoping this will allow future patterns & practices and future community deliverables to play nice together. Download it [here](http://www.codeplex.com/CommonServiceLocator).
