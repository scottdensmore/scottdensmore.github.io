We are making heavy use of the Parallel Programming Library in Native Code. I really love this. After our [PPL books](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg675934.aspx) from last year, I have really been interested in this. One of our awesome team members, Thomas Petchel, has [written up some intro material](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nativeconcurrency/archive/2012/05/07/check-out-hilo-for-windows-8.aspx) on our code displaying this.

Enjoy
