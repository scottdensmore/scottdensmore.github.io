> Swift and ReactiveCocoa seem like a perfect fit. Swift is designed with first-class functions and a succinct closure syntax, and ReactiveCocoa is all about implementing data flows using closures, in the form of Objective C blocks. Since blocks map onto Swift closures, it should be simple to get them playing nice, right?

This is a great pairing.  I hope I see more FRP now that swift is here.  I am hoping the Reactive Cocoa guys get a new version up with Swift.
