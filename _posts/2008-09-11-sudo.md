I really love running as a non admin, although I really miss [sudo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) from Unix. No longer, the smart peeps at [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/main/) do it again with [Su Do](http://alt.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/SuDo.html). Read more about it [here](http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/craig/archive/2008/09/09/announcing-sudo-for-windows.aspx). Big interwebs thanks to Craig!
