It must be that time of year. I have been at patterns & practices for a couple of years again and it has been awesome. Since I have been back I have worked on some great content with some great people.

I can't believe all the cool projects I have been on. More than that, the people I got to work with are amazing. If you ever wanted to to great work with great people you [could not find a better place](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bobbrum/archive/2012/06/11/patterns-amp-practices-is-hiring.aspx).

So where am I going? Visual Studio ALM! I am excited about this new opportunity. I will get to work with some new and [old friends](http://www.peterprovost.org/).  Looking forward to the new adventures.

Enjoy!
