[XP is the Mac of Agile](http://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2014/02/03/xp-is-the-mac-of-agile/):

> When Apple released the Macintosh it changed the face of computing. Graphical user interfaces, drag and drop icons, clickable menus. Since it’s release, the personal computer has never been the same.
> The same thing happened with the release of XP. Like an earthquake, it shook just about everything we traditionally believed and practiced in software delivery down to it’s core.
> And then both failed.
