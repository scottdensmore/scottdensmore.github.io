This is the 3rd in our series of Windows Azure Guidance.  This one is our release candidate and we should be done this week. There is a lot of post production to get the book done and onto MSDN, yet it will not be to much longer. While you wait, [give the RC a whirl](http://wag.codeplex.com/releases/view/74838).

Enjoy!
