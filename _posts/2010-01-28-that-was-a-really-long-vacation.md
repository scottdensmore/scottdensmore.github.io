In May it will be 2 years that I have been in the Sunshine State (Florida). I am going back to Seattle and Microsoft at the beginning of February. I have met and worked with a lot of great people. I will definitely miss the town (Celebration) and the sun, yet I can't wait to get back and take some of the great things I have learned from the people I have met while I was here. There are so many things I have done of the past couple of years that I don't think I would have had the chance/taken the time to do if I didn't live here. Here is a list in no particular order:

* Day of Ruby Orlando - This is were I met [Cory Foy](http://blog.cornetdesign.com/), [Corey Haines](http://www.coreyhaines.com/) and a bunch of guys from [HashRocket](http://www.hashrocket.com/). These guys were great and put on a great day "boot camp" of Ruby. The best part, as always, was the after dinner party and the 50oz steak.
* [Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com/) - This was an amazing trip. [Brad Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/) and I spent an entire week learning Cocoa from Arron Hillegass. Great time with some great people.
* [Disney](http://disney.go.com/index) - What can I say: happiest place on Earth. One thing I have to do now is teach the kids that a park is swings and monkey bars not Space Mountain, Epcot, Big Thunder Mountain etc. I think it might be a let down.
* [Disney Cruise](http://disneycruise.disney.go.com/) - Happiest place on the water :p. Spent time with [Peter Provost](http://www.peterprovost.org/) and family.
* [Channel Intelligence](http://www.channelintelligence.com/) - Met a lot of good people and probably the closest place to Microsoft I have been outside of Microsoft. Probably because it was started by a guy who worked at Microsoft.
* [Thuzi](http://www.thuzi.com/) - I met [Jim Zimmerman](http://www.jimzimmerman.com/blog/) while at a Tampa user group meeting and got into a long talk about MonoTouch and iPhone development (over beers of course). He decided I was crazy enough to work with them so I took a job working on Facebook Applications running on Windows Azure.
* TDD Firestarter - I met [Scott Reynolds](http://www.scottcreynolds.com/) and [Sean Chambers](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/sean_chambers/) in Tampa and they talked me into being a [Los Techie](http://www.lostechies.com/).
* Tampa MVC User Group - [David Hayden](http://www.davidhayden.com/) ran a great group and finally got to meet the man behind [p&p on the East Coast](http://www.pnpguidance.net/).
* [Celebration](http://celebrationtowncenter.com/)\- My little town. Love this place and I think I will miss this most of all.

I am sure there are many more things that I have forgotten yet all in all, great vacation. Lets go home Sparky!
